**UPDATED** removed use of this directory, because tags only work for _posts without heavy modification which I do not feel like doing right now.

a place to put all htb writeups to appear in Writeups. Format to follow:

---
layout: post
title:  "News Article Title!"
author: htb_handle
date:   YYYY-MM-DD
tags: tags [for tags to appear, there must be a tag markdown setup in /tag]
---

< content >
