We are a group of information technology professionals during the day, and computer hackers by night. All team members work in the information security field in one fashion or another. There is a collective background from defensive security administrators, offensive penetration testers and red teamers. We share a common goal of having a passion to learn to sharpen our skills. Whether we are at our home doing Hack The Box, online Capture The Flag challenges, Pentesterlabs, or at a con participating, we all enjoy learning new ways to gain privileged access.
