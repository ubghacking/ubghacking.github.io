We are a group of information technology professionals during the day, and computer hackers by night. All team members work in the information security field in one fashion or another. There is a collective background from defensive security administrators, offensive penetration testers and red teamers. We share a common goal of having a passion to learn to sharpen our skills. Whether we are at our home doing Hack The Box, online Capture The Flag challenges, Pentesterlabs, or at a con participating, we all enjoy learning new ways to gain privileged access.

Want to join our team? Message us on <a href="https://discordapp.com/users/165851543860543488" target="_blank">Discord</a>!

We need to get back into the top 100!

<h3>nan0byt3 - CEH</h3>
A Security Admin by day, and a hacking enthusiast by night (at least a few nights a week), nan0byt3 has been branded UBG since high school when the "clan" was into video games. UBG has since evolved into a hacking team, with still some original members who are still active in it. Nan0byt3 enjoys Hack the Box hacking the most, but is also active in TryHackMe, PentesterLabs and needs to attend more conferences and online CTF's. Join the team, help us get back into the top 100 teams, and let's grab a conference ticket for a CTF!
