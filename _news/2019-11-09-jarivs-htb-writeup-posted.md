Jarvis has now been retired, so I now have less points. But, now I can post my writeup! You can read our writeup <a href="https://ubghacking.github.io/2019/11/09/htb-jarvis.html">here</a> for the retired machine Jarvis from Hack The Box. This box goes through some SQLMap, a few reverse shell connections, and exploitation of python script, exploiting an escape from a command call to ping. Finally, leveraging a misconfigured suid bit as an unprivileged user to systemctl. Read our writeup to find out more!
