I am happy to announce that our very first writeup has been posted to the site. You can read our writeup <a href="https://ubghacking.github.io/2019/10/22/htb-ellingson.html">here</a> for the retired machine Ellingson from Hack The Box. This box was an awesome throwback to the 1995 film Hackers, one of my favorite movies and definitely known by (most) of the community. If you have not seen the movie, please go watch it (and don't mind how badly it has aged). The team is excited to release our first official post to the community! If you have any suggestions, or if you want to tell us we suck, please let us know on <a href="https://discordapp.com/users/165851543860543488" target="_blank">Discord</a>! Also, please keep checking back for further content.
