I am happy to announce that our very first writeup has been posted to the site. You can read our writeup <a href="https://ubghacking.github.io/2019/10/22/htb-ellingson.html">here</a> for the retired machine Ellingson from Hack The Box. This box was an awesome throwback to the 1995 Hackers, one of my favorite movies and definitely known by (most) of the community. If you have not seen the movie, please go watch it (and don't mind how badly it has aged). We are excited to make our first official post to the community! Please keep checking back for further content.
