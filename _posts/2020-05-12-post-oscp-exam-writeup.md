Hello, thanks for taking the time to read my post exam writeup for my first attempt at the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP). I say first attempt, because I just submitted my exam report yesterday, and I honestly do not know if I passed or not. Details on being unsure are to follow below. However, I am erager to write this to share with my (few) online support group that pushed me, and stuck with me, over the last several months. You guys rock, and even though you may not think you helped me, you kept me sane and helped me more then you may know. So, thank you!
