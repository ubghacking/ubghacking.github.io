I prefer to use GitBook for my notes. I really the the structure, compared to others like OneNote. The other benefit I find to GitBook is I absolutely enjoy the search functionality. I try to keep my notes in the best hierarchy and logical order which I can - but since I document everything, it can get rather cluttered.

I was using GitBook online, until I discovered I could also host it locally. Setup was rather pain free, as it uses Node.js to provide markdown files as content. Since I already had a web server in my homelab I could use, I will not cover how to stand one up. I use CentOS Stream 9 for my web server currently, so my notes will be specific to that Linux flavor.

Come back for the remainder of this guide soon!
