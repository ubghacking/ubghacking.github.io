This is one of my favorite Hack the Box machines, throughout my time completing them! I absolutely enjoyed every minute of this box.

My first NMAP scan, running with multiple flags, failed. I performed a simple nmap scan, and it returned only one port open:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
nmap 10.10.10.178

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 5.41 seconds
{% endhighlight %}

In the above, with port 445 open, I then ran a scan against SMB. Server Message Block (also known as Samba) is a way for Windows to share files, printers, serial ports and communications abstractions such as named pipes and mail slots between computers.

{% highlight bash linenos %}
smbclient -L //10.10.10.178
Enter WORKGROUP\root's password: 

        Sharename       Type      Comment

        C$              Disk      Default share

        Users           Disk      
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
{% endhighlight %}

The smbclient command showed that there were several network shares. I went through and connected to each, and found that I was able to login and find possible Usernames in the Users share. I took note of this:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
smbclient \\\\10.10.10.178\\Users
Enter WORKGROUP\root's password: 

smb: \> dir
  .                                   D        0  Sat Jan 25 17:04:21 2020

{% endhighlight %}

However, access was denied for each of the directories in this share. Continuing my enumeration of the network shares, I connected to Data, and found I could login to the Shared directory:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
smbclient \\\\10.10.10.178\\Data

                10485247 blocks of size 4096. 6449754 blocks available
{% endhighlight %}

In this directory, I found a file, Alerts.txt. I used the get command to transfer to my local box, to view the file:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
smb: \Shared\Maintenance\> dir
  .                                   D        0  Wed Aug  7 14:07:32 2019

root@bhax0r:~# cat 'Maintenance Alerts.txt'

{% endhighlight %}

However, still nothing! I then went back one directory, and logged into the Templates directory and found another file, "Welcome Email.txt". This sounded pronmising:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
smb: \Shared\Templates\HR\> dir
  .                                   D        0  Wed Aug  7 14:08:01 2019

{% endhighlight %}

And I found a possible set of credentials, tempuser:welcome2019. Noting the Users directory earlier, I logged back in with these credentials to that directory:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
smbclient \\\\10.10.10.178\\Users -U TempUser

root@hax0r:~# cat 'New Text Document.txt' 
{% endhighlight %}

However, this did not have any further inforamtion for me. I then attempted to login to the Users share with the other usernamers, using the same password (users don't always change default passwords) but this also did not work. So, I moved on and used these credentials agaisnt other shares. I did find that it allowed me into Secure$:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
smbclient \\\\10.10.10.178\\Secure$ -U TempUser
Enter WORKGROUP\TempUser's password:

 {% endhighlight %}
 
 However, there was nothing within that network share that I could use to my advantage. Moving on, I was able to log into the Data share with the tempuser credentials:
 
 I found two interesting files in this share, RU_config.xml and config.xml:
 
 {% highlight bash linenos %}

Neither of these looked like much at first, but there is relevant and important information. The first, we have a username and password from the RU_config.xml. The second can be easily missed, and this is the second FIle filename variable in config.xml. I can see that in the network share Secure$, there is a Carl directory in the IT directory. In the RU_config.xml, there is a c.smith password, can this be Carl!?

I logged in and attempted to see if I could get to the Carl directory:
