This is one of my favorite Hack the Box machines, throughout my time completing them! I absolutely enjoyed every minute of this box.

My first NMAP scan, running with multiple flags, failed. I performed a simple nmap scan, and it returned only one port open:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
nmap 10.10.10.178                                                                                     
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-01-28 09:25 CST                                                      
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.178                                                                                    
Host is up (0.043s latency).                                                                                         
Not shown: 999 filtered ports                                                                                        
PORT    STATE SERVICE                                                                                                
445/tcp open  microsoft-ds                                                                                           
                                                                                                                     
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 5.41 seconds
{% endhighlight %}

In the above, with port 445 open, I then ran a scan against SMB. Server Message Block (also known as Samba) is a way for Windows to share files, printers, serial ports and communications abstractions such as named pipes and mail slots between computers.
