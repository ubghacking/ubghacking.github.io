Recently, while I was going for my Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certificate, I ran into a machine in the labs which had a restricted PowerShell. Simply stated, I could not enter into an interactive PowerShell session or run any PowerShell scripts. PowerShell has several execution policies which can be set on a system, and these execution policies determines which scripts can be run. By default, this is set to "Restricted". From Microsoft, restricted "doesn't load configuration files or run scripts. The default execution policy Windows client computers."
