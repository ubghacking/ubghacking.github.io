Recently, while I was going for my Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certificate, I ran into a machine in the labs which had a restricted PowerShell. Simply stated, I could not enter into an interactive PowerShell session or run any PowerShell scripts. PowerShell has several execution policies which can be set on a system, and these execution policies determines which scripts can be run. By default, this is set to "Restricted". From Microsoft, restricted "doesn't load configuration files or run scripts. The default execution policy Windows client computers."

However, there is an execution policy which, as penetration testers, we want to have set. This is "Bypass", which states "nothing is blocked and there are no warnings or prompts." If we were able run with PowerShell with bypass, then even though the default restricted is set as an execution policy, our commands would still run. To run a PowerShell command with bypass mode is simply done with:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass "whoami"
{% endhighlight %}

Or, for shorthand:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
powershell -exec bypass "whoami"
{% endhighlight %}
