<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

There really is no shortage in Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) study paths and recommendations. I wanted to add to many that are out there, and describe my self study path, and the tools I used, which aided me in passing my CISSP exam on my first attempt.

This exam is incredibly different from any I have ever taken. I have been asked which was harder, OSCP or CISSP. And, honestly, I cannot say which is "harder". They are not really comparable. Offensive Securities Certified Professional (OSCP) is a very hands on technical cert with a demanding 24 hour exam, requiring hands on keyboard. On the flip side, CISSP was months of reading, memorization, and practice tests for a 3 hour multiple choice. They are very different exams.

This exam took me three months to study for, from first cracking open the first book to provisionally passing the examn. I have a Bachelors of Science in Cybersecurity from COlorado Technical University, and have been in IT for four years. I decided to take the CISSP because I finally met the basic requirements for the full certification. That's not to say that reciving your Associates of CISSP would not be worth it - I just decided to wait. I started as Dekstop support, then was a Security Administrator, and now am a Systems Administrator.

<h3>Preparation</h3>

I used the following tools to study for the CISSP:

<h4>Official (ISC)² CISSP Study Guide, 9th Edition</h4>

<h4>LinkedIn Learning Videos</h4>

<h4>FEDVte Videos</h4>

<h4>Boson Practice Exams</h4>

<h4>Thor Teaches</h4>

<h4>CISSP - (ISC)² Official App</h4>\
